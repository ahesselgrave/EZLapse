# EZLapse
EZLapse is an Android app that helps users take timelapse photos by using previously taken photos. This helps users take more accurate and less jittery timelapses to get a better sense of chronology of whatever they want to see.

This is the final submission for 2015 SBHacks. Continued app progress has been forked to ultimatedbzt.
